# Purpose:
# This script demonstrates how to perform position control in Cartesian space.

# Hardware setup:
# 1. A WXAI V0 arm with leader end effector and ip at 192.168.1.2

# The script does the following:
# 1. Initializes the driver
# 2. Configures the driver for one arm
# 3. Sets the arm joints to position mode
# 4. Moves the end effector around in Cartesian space
# 5. The driver automatically sets the mode to idle at the destructor
